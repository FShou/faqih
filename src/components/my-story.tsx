        Hi there! I'm <span className="font-medium text-primary">Faqih</span>.
        Before diving into tech, I worked as a teacher in an Islamic Boarding
        School, which really helped me improve my communication and time
        management skills—both of which are super useful when working in a team.

      <p className="text-primary/80 md:text-lg w-full">
        Now, I’m studying{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-primary">
          Informatics Engineering
        </span>
        , with a focus on Android development. One of the best parts of my
        journey has been joining{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-primary">Bangkit Academy 2024</span>.
        This fantastic program, supported by companies like{" "}
        <i>Google, GoTo, Tokopedia, and Traveloka</i>, taught me valuable skills
        in Android technology and gave me great insights into the tech industry.
        It was an exciting opportunity that helped me grow both personally and
        professionally.

      <p className="text-primary/80 md:text-lg w-full">
        I’m really excited to apply what I’ve learned in new projects and
        collaborate with others who share my passion for technology. I believe
        that every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, and I
        can’t wait to see where this journey takes me !
